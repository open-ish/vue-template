# vue-template - Nice approaches to use in VueJS projects ‚ù§Ô∏è

Hi, everyone! üëã

This is a nice repo with some approaches to use in VueJS (2.x | 3.x) projects.

If you wanna, let's get in touch! 

## Summary

- Approaches

1. [Creating breadcrumb](#Breadcrumb) 

- Config

2. [Pre-requirements](#Installation)

## Breadcrumb

Here, you will find two approaches to creating breadcrum with VueJS and VueRotuer, the first idea is to create keys at route config and treat it in breadcrumb itself. Regarding secondapproach, the idea is to create a breadcrumb state and change it at route changing.
