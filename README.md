# vue-template - Breadcrum apprach

Hi, everyone! ðŸ‘‹

This is a nice repo with some approaches to use in VueJS (2.x) projects. [You may find more here](https://github.com/open-ish/vue2-template) or change by the branch at GitHub.

If you wanna, let's get in touch! 

## Summary

1. [Approach 1 - Using finder field at router config ðŸš€](#Approach-1---finder-field)
2. [Approach 2 - Creating breadcrumb state at route config and changing it at routes](#Approach-2---breadcrumb-state)
3. [Pre-requirements](#Installation)

## Approach 1 - finder field

At this approach, the idea is to create keys at route config and treat it in breadcrumb itself. 

Key files:
